# About This Project
I took on this project to sharpen my data analysis and forecasting skills in Excel while exploring an important real-world issue in government debt. My goal was to analyze historical debt data, identify trends in yearly and monthly debt growth, and forecast future public debt.

By leveraging Excelâ€™s analytical tools, I created dynamic visualizations and predictive models to uncover key insights about debt patterns and potential future trends.
