# About This Project
I took on this project to sharpen my data analysis and forecasting skills in Excel while exploring an important real-world issue in government debt. My goal was to analyze historical debt data, identify trends in yearly and monthly debt growth, and forecast future public debt.

By leveraging Excel’s analytical tools, I created dynamic visualizations and predictive models to uncover key insights about debt patterns and potential future trends.

# What I Analyzed
I focused on three main questions:
• How much did U.S. debt increase each year? (Yearly Debt Percentage Increase)
• Which months historically see the highest or lowest debt growth? (Monthly Debt Trends)
• What does the future of publicly held debt look like? (Debt Growth Projections)

# Tools & Techniques Used
