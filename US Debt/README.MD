# About This Project
I took on this project to sharpen my data analysis and forecasting skills in Excel while exploring an important real-world issue in government debt. My goal was to analyze historical debt data, identify trends in yearly and monthly debt growth, and forecast future public debt.

By leveraging Excel’s analytical tools, I dove into historical debt data, created dynamic visualizations, and built forecasts to tell a story about the patterns behind government debt.

# What I Analyzed
I focused on three main questions:
• How much did U.S. debt increase each year? (Yearly Debt Percentage Increase)
• Which months historically see the highest or lowest debt growth? (Monthly Debt Trends)
• What does the future of publicly held debt look like? (Debt Growth Projections)

# Tools & Techniques Used
Excel Formulas & Functions: Cleaning and analyzing the data
Pivot Tables & Charts: Spotting trends and making insights visual
Forecasting Models: Predicting future debt growth
Conditional Formatting: Highlighting key takeaways

# Key Takeaways
Yearly Debt Percentage Increase:
From 2016 to 2019, the yearly debt increase averaged around 5%.
A significant spike occurred in 2020, likely due to U.S. pandemic responses.

Months with Highest/Lowest Debt Increases:
Highest debt increases: January, February, November, and December.
Lowest debt increases: April, May, June, and July.
Possible reason: High debt months align with major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's), suggesting seasonal spending as a contributing factor.

Projected Growth of Publicly Held Debt:
1997–2007: Increased by $1 trillion.
2008–2019: Increased from $6 trillion to $17 trillion.
2020–2022: Increased from $21.5 trillion to $25 trillion.
2023–2027 (Projection): Expected to rise to $33 trillion.

Trend: Publicly held debt is projected to continue increasing at a steady rate.
Further Research Areas: Stock market, housing market, credit card purchases, unemployment rates.
