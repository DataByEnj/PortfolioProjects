# Project Overview
As a passionate data enthusiast, I created this project to explore real-world salary trends in the data science industry. I aimed to dive deep into this dataset and uncover meaningful insights about how compensation varies by experience level, job title, location, and more.

This project was more than just an analysis; it was a hands-on learning experience. By combining curiosity with SQL skills, I explored key questions that guided me on my journey, such as:

• What are the average salaries for different experience levels and roles?
• How does remote work or company size impact compensation?
• What regional differences exist in salary data, and why might those differences occur?

Through this project, I aimed to enhance my technical skills and better understand industry standards, which would help me navigate career planning in data science.
